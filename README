Min-init

Based on mininit from Ignacio Garcia Perez
(http://code.google.com/p/dingoo-linux/)

This simple program permits to use a romfs/squashfs image as the root filesystem of a linux system.
You will need to specify three parameters on the kernel command line:
- 'boot=X' where X is a comma-separated list of the possible locations for the filesystem on which is stored the image;
- 'loop0=X' where X is the path to the image (e.g. /boot/rootfs.bin);
- 'root=/dev/loop0' which defines the loopback mount as being the root file system.

For each path specified as an argument of the 'boot' kernel parameter, min-init will try to mount the corresponding drive
with every filesystem type the kernel understands, until the mount eventually succeeds.
